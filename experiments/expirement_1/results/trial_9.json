In June 2018, OpenAI released a paper entitled \"Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training\", in which they introduced that initial model along with the general concept of a generative pre-trained transformer.\n\n---\n\n*Note: The domshell MCP tools were configured but not available as callable tools in this session, so I fetched the pages directly via curl.
